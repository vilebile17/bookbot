# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

In order to use this bot, you'll need to get a bit of text, like a book and place it in the repo. Then run this line:
```
python3 main.py <pathToText>
```
And that should write out the frequencies of each character in that piece of text!
