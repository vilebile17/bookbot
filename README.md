# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

To use the bot, run main.py with the additional argument of the file path to the book file.
For example, "python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt"

In that example "python3 main.py" tells the computer to run main.py using python.
And "books/frankenstein.txt" is the file path to a book.
